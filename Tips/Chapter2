"Do not try to work with as many commands as possible when working with vim. Just
use a minimal set of commands and use them often. You’ll see; you’ll get used to these
commands and remember them on the exam. Also, you may like the vimtutor
command. (You may have to use dnf install vim-enhanced to install it; Chapter 9,
“Managing Software,” provides more details about software installation.) This
command opens a vim tutorial that has you work through some nice additional
exercises." -Pg 38

"Nearly all commands provide a short overview of help when the option --help is used.
Some commands do not honor that option and consider it erroneous. Fortunately, these
commands will be so friendly as to show an error message, displaying valid options with
the command, which effectively means that you’ll get what you needed anyway." -Pg 43

"Instead of using man -k, you can use the apropos command, which is equivalent to
man -k." -Pg 45

"Do not try to memorize all the commands that you need to accomplish specific tasks.
Instead, memorize how to find these commands and find which man page to read to get
more information about the command." -Pg 46
